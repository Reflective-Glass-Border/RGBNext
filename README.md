Please visit https://github.com/Reflective-Glass-Border/RGBKart instead for the latest updates, releases, and commits. Thanks <3.

Aparently it's basically impossible to remove LFS files and restore this repo to pre-lfs. Best way to fix this is to delete the repo and start fresh. I want to keep this repo to archive old builds of the game, so I started a new repo instead.
